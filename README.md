## 🚀 About Me

I ship **fast, clean, and scalable products**. My work spans backend engineering, system design, AI integrations, and full-stack development. I don't just code—I architect solutions that scale and solve real-world problems.

> 💡 **My mantra:** Build → Break → Fix → Optimize → Ship

Currently exploring: High-performance systems, distributed architectures, and AI-powered applications.
